# ChopAndScrewPad
Chop And Screw Pad is an online-based Chopped and Screwed DJ Music application that lets you DJ slowed down music (22 - 30% slower) and adds vinyl crackle, tape emulation sounds and a crossfade. 

Inspired by the Chopped and Screwed music genre, designed for easy online use. This is a working alpha version.

The project is written in javascript and uses Tone.JS and P5.Sound for the sound loading and manipulation and NexusUI for the interface.

This is a first version, and it has working drag and drop. We'd love to go back in and give more options and a dedicated site to host it. Tim and Lee have been playing, making and performing chopped and screwed music for about 5 years now, so this was a natural project to work on today. It's our first Music Hackathon. We hope to use this framework/system to build more online DJ software and further filtering options.
